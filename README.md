## Description

A third **updated portfolio** and other professional materials, shared as I build toward being employer-competitive. This version is built in React and contains some updates to organization, behaviors, and styling that are designed to meet this particular assignment's criteria. 

## Core Objectives Met

1. When the portfolio loads, the user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
2. When the header is viewed, the user is presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
3. When the navigation titles are viewed, the user is presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
4. When a navigation title is clicked, the user is presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
5. When the portfolio is loaded for the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default.
6. When the About Me section is presented, the user sees a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
7. When the Portfolio section is presented, the user sees titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
8. When the Contact section is presented, the user sees a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
9. When the user moves their cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, they receive a notification that the field is required.
10. When a user enters text into the e-mail address field, they receive notification if they have entered an invalid email address.
11. When the Resume section is presented, the user sees a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies.
12. When the footer is viewed, the user is presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
